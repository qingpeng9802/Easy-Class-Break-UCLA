# Easy-Class-Break-UCLA
Find out the classes whose break is not enough to walk to the next class.
  
The extension will check all class breaks in the Class Planner. If the extension find a class whose break is not enough to walk to the next class, that is (break time - walking time) <= 2min, the extension will insert a red button below the location box in the Class Planner to tip you.
  
The red button will be ["Ori"+ weekday] (not enough time to get next class + the class on which weekday) or ["Ori"+ weekday] (not enough time to go from previous class + the class on which weekday).
  
Hover over the red button will display more information about next/previous class and time/distance.

# About the extension:
In a quarter, I had a discussion session in Boelter Hall, and next discussion session in Public Affairs Building, it took me a long time to walk, and it is inconveninent to ask TA questions after discussion. Then, the idea of the extension was inspired by the discussion with Jonathan of this situation.
